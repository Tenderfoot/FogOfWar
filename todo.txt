Potential Feature Development
================

====
next up
====
- fix how selection works
- User interface
	- Selectable information
	- Progress bar for buildings / unit
- Building location in invalid spot
	-farms blocked on 3x3?
	-show spot status

=====
Future Development
=====
- Fog of War
- Tree Harvesting
- Ranged Attacks
	-Projectile network replicated
- Spells

===============
Bugs
===============
- multiple chars ending up on the same tile (attack move problem?)
- Skeleton attack move to townhall should use adjacent squares (causing blocked)
- Gatherers getting blocked going to the goldmine in a similar manner
- When 1 square away and blocked just reach destination (unnecissary max recurses)
- attack move stopping after target dies [hacked in process_command]
- distant townhall thing
- find path should be threaded
- calc_all_tiles eats memory (genbuffers I think)

=======
other stuff
=======
- Editor improvement: "Edit Mode" (set team, remove entities)
- Editor improvement: Entity creation for export / import (?)
- fix vertex colors with VBOs
- Building Units improvement (take time to build)
- make FOWBuilding and FOWCharacter instanceable for the editor, and control the skin change stuff

=======
Network stuff
=======
- Client can't actually do anything (input, damage)
- Make entity visible network replicated
- Attack state replication
- on connect clear client Game::entities and release associated memory, refill with server data
	- or even better, fix game so if you're a client you don't load a map, you get it from server
- same with tile data?
- for FOWBuilding send building state (under construction) and percentage complete (units)

=====
refactor
=====
- attack & attack move DRY (just investigate)

=====
Polish:
=====
- Selection type notification (X)
- Attack move mode cursor
- New Tiletypes (Dark Grass, Walls, Cut Trees)
- Lights / Shaders
- particle effects
	-on hit

===============
Potential Animation Work
===============
- Ranged attack

=====
god goals
=====
- lua support
- netcode

===============
murdered
===============
- Unit Teams
	- don't take commands
	- red selection
- AI behaviour
	- Scan area around
	- Attack closest target
- Fix Death
	- remove entity_on_position
	- basic anim
- Screen scroll
- Fixed some things
- Level Loading improvement (JSON)
- Vertex Buffer Objects
- Hotkeys
	- Fix key enum thing...
	- Each unit hotkey is seperate, mapped to sdlkey
- Swing attack Direction, animations
- Death animation
- Knight and Skeleton
	-Split out movement to allow proper instancing
- Skin switching framework
	-Sword
	-Gold Bag
- popping out a bunch of people while people are collecting = unselectable entities
- Building Buildings improvement
- Sound Effects
- New buildings
	- Farm, Barracks
- Attack Move
	- Command
	- Move to location, attack along the way
- Fix attack move for sight size / add move to target step
- Damage / Health improvement
- Editor Improvement (place characters, map size)
- move selectable methods to a cpp file
- spine_manager DRY
- buildings pop out units in blocked area
- Map perimeter issues
- attack move command pathing should ignore enemies
- Minimap
- Text resources
- make a grid_manager method that outputs mouse coords as t_vertex (Game::coord_mouse_pos was solution)
- entity on position or wall find_path (added safety check) (same as next one)
- Prevent find_path to a blocked tile (unnecissary max recurses)
- Blocked state
- Attack move on minimap don't teleport camera and remove selection
- command affirmative sound per unit
- refactored (static classes)
- for FOWCharacter send state and current_path from server to client
