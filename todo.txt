Potential Feature Development
================

=====
Tonight
=====

	- up to 32 bit int?
	- projectile working on network
	- multiple players

===========
build fixes
===========
- Tower
- Unit Color
- distant townhall thing
- Archer and Knight both come out of barracks

=====
Gameplay
=====
- Fog of War
- Spells
- Status Effects

Visual
=====
- Lights
- Particle Emitters

===============
Bugs
===============
- multiple chars ending up on the same tile (attack move problem?)
- Skeleton attack move to townhall should use adjacent squares (causing blocked)
- Gatherers getting blocked going to the goldmine in a similar manner
- When 1 square away and blocked just reach destination (unnecissary max recurses)
- attack move stopping after target dies [hacked in process_command]
- find path should be threaded
- calc_all_tiles eats memory (genbuffers I think)
- Gatherer building setting is bad
- buildings looking for space check 3x3 regardless of size
- popout at the perimeter puts people off arrays I think (building farm)
- why does decorations take a gig of memory
- decorations breaks if there are none of that kind of decoration available
- building a building and then failing another building lets you build a 3x3 in a 2x2 spot
- in SDL_OpenGL.h, //GLAPI void GLAPIENTRY glActiveTexture( GLenum texture );

=======
Editor Related
=======
- Editor improvement: "Edit Mode" (set team, remove entities)
- Editor improvement: Entity creation for export / import (?)
- fix vertex colors with VBOs
- make FOWBuilding and FOWCharacter instanceable for the editor, and control the skin change stuff

========
Main Menu
========
- Settings
	- Resolution
	- Fullscreen
	- Sound Effects Volume
	- Music Volume

=======
Network stuff
=======
- for FOWBuilding send building state (under construction) and percentage complete (units)
- Sending only what the client needs
- literally any number going over 256
- all the casting to selectable by default is gunna have to go

=====
refactor
=====
- put tile retrieval logic in grid_manager
- get_adjacent_tiles_from_position in gridmanager and get_adjacent_tiles on selectable are the same

=====
Polish:
=====
- Selection type notification (X)
- Attack move mode cursor
- New Tiletypes (Dark Grass, Walls, Cut Trees)
- click audio cue
- Unit color
- queue units
- User interface
	- Selectable information
- Building location in invalid spot
	-show spot status
- Tree Harvesting improvement
	- find new wood source when you run out

god goals

- Gameplay
- Visual 
- Editor
- Polish

stupid ideas
============
- mission briefing where you barely talk about the mission

===============
murdered
===============
- Unit Teams
	- don't take commands
	- red selection
- AI behaviour
	- Scan area around
	- Attack closest target
- Fix Death
	- remove entity_on_position
	- basic anim
- Screen scroll
- Fixed some things
- Level Loading improvement (JSON)
- Vertex Buffer Objects
- Hotkeys
	- Fix key enum thing...
	- Each unit hotkey is seperate, mapped to sdlkey
- Swing attack Direction, animations
- Death animation
- Knight and Skeleton
	-Split out movement to allow proper instancing
- Skin switching framework
	-Sword
	-Gold Bag
- popping out a bunch of people while people are collecting = unselectable entities
- Building Buildings improvement
- Sound Effects
- New buildings
	- Farm, Barracks
- Attack Move
	- Command
	- Move to location, attack along the way
- Fix attack move for sight size / add move to target step
- Damage / Health improvement
- Editor Improvement (place characters, map size)
- move selectable methods to a cpp file
- spine_manager DRY
- buildings pop out units in blocked area
- Map perimeter issues
- attack move command pathing should ignore enemies
- Minimap
- Text resources
- make a grid_manager method that outputs mouse coords as t_vertex (Game::coord_mouse_pos was solution)
- entity on position or wall find_path (added safety check) (same as next one)
- Prevent find_path to a blocked tile (unnecissary max recurses)
- Blocked state
- Attack move on minimap don't teleport camera and remove selection
- command affirmative sound per unit
- refactored (static classes)
- for FOWCharacter send state and current_path from server to client
- Client can't actually do anything (input)
- Build unit commands (client)
- Attack state replication
- Client doesn't do damage - broadcast death from server (catches dying state change instead)
- Make entity visible network replicated
- building buildings on client bug (fix spine thread vbo issue)
- gold bag replicated (fix spine thread vbo issue)
- safer setanimation for spine_initialized (clientstuff)
- fix how selection works
- discrete players
	-- add base 2
	-- fix gatherer cycle for multiple players
	-- client builds team aligned units and structures
	-- command confirmed audio for all teams coming through 
	-- change server to just do the loop + error message on connect
        -- data getter index thing
        -- data setter index thing
	-- Fix ready sound
	-- fix money / spend
- add host IP setting to user_settings
- host_name settings file bug
- can't select dead or invisible units
- deselect dead units
- attempt fix and clienthandler crash (concurrency - gameentity mutex unique_lock)
- Main Menu
	- UIWidget MenuWidget or something
	- Quit
	- Single Player
		- Map List
	- Multiplayer
		- Host Game
		- Join Game
- fix game so if you're a client you don't load a map, you get it from server (kind of - map filename)
- supply
- unit build time
- building cost
- drop building if placing and dont' want to (deselect units with escape)
- building health / destruction
	- replicate building destruction on client
- lerp
- attack move problem investigation (fixed!!!)
- sound volume
- go idle after a building is destroyed
- check_attack when idle
- User interface
	- Progress bar for units
- Trees, FOWDecoration class
- Minimap is now a vbo (huge performance improvement)
- Shaders
- GLM
- FOWDecoration Megatron
- Ranged Attacks
	- merged in
- Water
- attack & attack move DRY
- Tree Harvesting
- Error message text on screen fade away
