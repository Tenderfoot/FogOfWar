Bugs
===============
- multiple chars ending up on the same tile (attack move problem?)
- Prevent find_path to a blocked tile (unnecissary max recurses)
- Skeleton attack move to townhall should use adjacent squares (causing blocked)
- Gatherers getting blocked going to the goldmine in a similar manner
- When 1 square away and blocked just reach destination (unnecissary max recurses)
- attack move stopping after target dies [hacked in process_command]
- distant townhall thing

=======
other stuff
=======
- Editor improvement: "Edit Mode" (set team, remove entities)
- Editor improvement: Entity creation for export / import (?)
- fix vertex colors with VBOs
- Building Units improvement (take time to build)
- make FOWBuilding and FOWCharacter instanceable for the editor, and control the skin change stuff

=====
refactor
=====
- attack & attack move DRY (just investigate)

=====
Polish:
=====
- Selection type notification (X)
- Attack move mode cursor
